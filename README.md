# awe-workshop-2019
Welcome to the workshop as part of the Airborne Wind Energy course 2019. Please make sure to come to the lecture
prepared by following the lower instructions.

Either clone this repository, or manually download it to your working folder (extract the .zip archive) if you are not
familiar with git. Also make sure that you have Python 3 installed. If you're new to Python, we recommend you to install
it using Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook and required
packages already installed. If you are not using Anaconda, please install it yourself. Consult
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html for installing Jupyter Notebook and execute the lower command to
install the required packages.

```commandline
pip install --user scipy numpy matplotlib
```

In Windows you can launch Jupyter Notebooks simply via the start menu. In Linux use the lower command in a terminal.

```commandline
jupyter notebook
```

If everything went well, Jupyter Notebook should now be opened in your browser. Navigate to the working folder and open
'awe_workshop_2019.ipynb'. If you have any problems, please send an email to m.schelbergen@tudelft.nl, or come by my
office 6.08 at LR with your laptop.
