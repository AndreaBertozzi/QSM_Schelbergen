# awe-workshop-2019
Welcome to the workshop as part of the Airborne Wind Energy course 2019. Please make sure to come to the lecture
prepared by following the lower instructions.

Either clone this repository, or manually download it to your working folder (extract the .zip archive). Also make
sure that you have Python 3 installed. If you're new to Python, we recommend you to install it using Anaconda:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebook. If you already have Python
installed, please make sure to install Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html.
We also need to install 2 packages. Install them by executing the lower command in your terminal.

```commandline
conda install numpy matplotlib
```

Finally, navigate to your working folder. We simply launch Jupyter Notebooks using the lower command.

```commandline
jupyter notebook
```

If you have any problems, please send an email to m.schelbergen@tudelft.nl, or come by my office 6.08 at LR with your
laptop.
